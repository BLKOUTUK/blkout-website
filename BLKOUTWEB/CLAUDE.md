# Claude Code Configuration - BLKOUT Community Liberation Platform

## Project Context
**Project**: BLKOUTUK Digital Strategy - Technology for Black Queer Liberation  
**Branch**: `001-blkoutuk-digital-strategy`  
**Status**: Implementation Planning Phase  
**Community Values**: Democratic governance, creator sovereignty, economic justice, accessibility-first design

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js Progressive Web App with offline-first service workers
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+) with PostgreSQL for community data sovereignty  
- **Governance**: Decidim integration with Loomio for democratic decision-making
- **Identity**: IndieWeb protocols (Webmention, microformats) for creator-controlled content
- **AI Integration**: Self-hosted models with community oversight and transparent logging
- **Architecture**: Federated platform cooperative with API-first design

## Community Benefit Society Requirements
- One-member-one-vote democratic governance for all platform decisions
- Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014 compliance
- Economic value flows to creators and community rather than external shareholders
- Transparent decision-making processes and financial distribution
- Community ownership of platform infrastructure and data

## Development Principles

### Liberation-Centered Development
- All features must center Black queer liberation and community empowerment
- Creator sovereignty: Content creators maintain full narrative and economic control
- Community data sovereignty: Democratic control over all data policies and usage
- Economic justice: Transparent revenue sharing with majority return to creators
- Accessibility-first: WCAG 3.0 Bronze minimum, progressive enhancement to Gold

### Democratic Development Process
- Community input required for all major technical and policy decisions
- TDD with community acceptance criteria: Community needs → Failing tests → Implementation
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle with community accountability at each phase
- No implementation without community-validated test cases

### Technical Architecture Principles
- Library-first development: governance-lib, community-lib, content-lib
- CLI per library with community-facing documentation
- API-first federation enabling community platform connections
- Progressive Web App supporting feature phones through high-end devices
- Offline-first operation with intelligent caching and synchronization

## Key Entities & Relationships
- **Community Member**: Central entity with engagement levels from visitor to cooperative owner
- **Governance Decision**: Democratic choices with one-member-one-vote and transparent implementation
- **Content**: Creator-sovereign content with economic distribution tracking
- **Creator**: Specialized community member with narrative and economic sovereignty
- **Event**: In-person gatherings with digital relationship continuation
- **Committee**: Member-driven governance groups with transparent decision-making authority

## API Standards
- RESTful design following community governance principles
- OpenAPI 3.0 documentation with community accessibility requirements
- Authentication via community member JWT with democratic access control
- Error responses include community support context
- All endpoints include accessibility and inclusion considerations

## Testing Requirements
- Contract tests for all API endpoints with community governance validation
- Integration tests for democratic processes, creator economy, and accessibility features
- End-to-end tests covering full user journeys from discovery to cooperative ownership
- Community acceptance testing for all liberation-focused features
- Performance testing ensuring 3-second load times on 2G networks

## Accessibility & Inclusion Standards
- WCAG 3.0 compliance with Bronze minimum, Gold target
- Multi-language support with cultural adaptation beyond translation
- Screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation
- Low-bandwidth mode for limited connectivity contexts
- Community-controlled privacy settings with liberation-focused defaults

## Economic Sovereignty Features
- Transparent creator compensation tracking (75% minimum to creators)
- Community benefit distribution (25% maximum to community operations)
- Platform cooperative governance with democratic economic decisions
- Direct creator-community economic relationships without extractive intermediaries
- Community-controlled monetization with democratic oversight

## AI Integration Guidelines
- Community AI Ethics Committee with technical veto power over AI deployment
- Transparent AI usage disclosure and decision audit logging
- Self-hosted AI models with community-controlled infrastructure
- Consent-based training data with creator attribution and copyright respect
- Democratic oversight of all AI system changes and policy decisions

## Recent Development Context
**Phase 0**: Research completed on community-owned liberation technology platforms
**Phase 1**: Data model, API contracts, and quickstart validation scenarios complete
**Current**: Ready for /tasks command to generate implementation task breakdown
**Next**: Community-validated TDD implementation following democratic development principles

## Community Governance Integration
- All code changes subject to community democratic oversight for major platform impacts
- Technical decisions affecting community liberation or economic sovereignty require community vote
- Creator and accessibility features prioritized over convenience or performance optimizations
- Community feedback integration sessions for ongoing platform evolution
- Democratic platform governance with transparent technical decision-making processes

## Performance & Constraints
- Progressive Web App with offline-first architecture
- Service workers for intelligent caching and background synchronization  
- Response times under 3 seconds on 2G network simulation
- 99.9% uptime for community organizing and democratic governance access
- Community data sovereignty with privacy-preserving analytics
