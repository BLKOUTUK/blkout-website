# IVOR Community Liberation Technology Platform - PHASE 2 PRD

## Journey-Aware Knowledge Architecture for Community Empowerment

**Document Version**: 2.0  
**Phase**: 2 - Intelligent Knowledge Enhancement  
**Date**: August 25, 2025  
**Status**: Development Ready  

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Phase 1** successfully established a community-focused AI platform with 6 operational services (4 domain services + API Gateway + Frontend) delivering referral-based responses serving Black queer liberation goals. **Phase 2** transforms this foundation into an intelligent, journey-aware knowledge system that provides specific, actionable information based on where users are in their liberation journey.

**Core Innovation**: Moving from **TOPIC-AWARE** to **JOURNEY-STAGE-AWARE** AI that understands user context and provides targeted support for their specific stage of community empowerment.

---

## üîç PROBLEM STATEMENT

### **Current State Analysis**
Phase 1 delivered effective referral-based responses but revealed fundamental limitations:

1. **Topic-Only Recognition**: System recognizes "HIV support" but not whether user needs testing, new diagnosis support, or long-term care
2. **Generic Information Delivery**: Provides good referrals but lacks specific, actionable information from source content  
3. **Journey-Blind Responses**: Same response regardless of where user is in their empowerment journey
4. **Limited Context Understanding**: Cannot distinguish between different user needs within same topic area

### **Community Impact Gap**
Users need AI that:
- Understands their specific stage in liberation journey
- Provides actionable information, not just referrals
- Recognizes context differences (new crisis vs. ongoing support)
- Offers pathway guidance to next empowerment stage

---

## üöÄ PHASE 2 VISION

### **Journey-Aware Community AI**
Transform IVOR into an intelligent knowledge system that:

1. **Recognizes Liberation Journey Stages** across all community domains
2. **Provides Specific, Actionable Information** extracted from authoritative sources
3. **Offers Context-Appropriate Support** based on user circumstances
4. **Guides Progressive Empowerment** with pathways to next journey stage

### **Universal Journey Architecture**
Every community domain (wellness, organizing, intelligence, social) operates on journey-stage principles:

**IVOR Core Journey**: Crisis ‚Üí Stabilization ‚Üí Growth ‚Üí Community Healing ‚Üí Advocacy
**IVOR Organizing Journey**: Awareness ‚Üí Education ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Leadership ‚Üí System Change  
**IVOR Community Journey**: Individual Problem ‚Üí Community Pattern ‚Üí Strategic Analysis ‚Üí Collective Action
