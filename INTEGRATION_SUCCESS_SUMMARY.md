### **Frontend Data Flow**
```typescript
// Live backend connection in ArticleGrid
const [backendStatus, setBackendStatus] = useState<'checking' | 'connected' | 'offline'>('checking')

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchStories = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/newsroom/stories')
      // Convert API data to component format
      const convertedArticles = data.stories.map(convertStoryToArticle)
      setArticles(convertedArticles)
      setBackendStatus('connected')
    } catch (error) {
      setBackendStatus('offline')
      setArticles(mockArticles) // Graceful fallback
    }
  }
}, [])
```

### **Story Submission Workflow**
```typescript
// Community story submission in CommunityGateway
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/newsroom/submissions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(formData)
  })
