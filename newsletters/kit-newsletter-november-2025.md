# BLKOUT Community Newsletter - November 2025

## "Sit down and weep, and still be counted as warriors"

Brothers,

> *"no person, trying to take responsibility for her or his identity, should have to be so alone. There must be those among whom we can sit down and weep, and still be counted as warriors."*
> — Adrienne Rich

We created the BLKOUT platform as **a space for us to think, shout, show off, curse, celebrate, laugh, reflect and share.** Our own space to hear and be heard, beyond the empty rhetoric of 'representation' or 'clout'. Black queer men, if you've got something you want to say to other Black queer men, this is the platform.

This month, I want to highlight why our **Community Story Submission** feature matters - and it connects directly to a piece we published that every brother needs to read.

## 📖 Required Reading: "Counted As Warriors?"

**[READ: Counted As Warriors? - 50 Years of Pride & The Fight for Black Queer Liberation →](https://blkoutuk.com/long-read-counted-as-warriors/)**

This long-form article examines 50 years of Gay Pride matched by 50 years of failure among movements for racial justice in the UK to see that **none of us are free until we are all free.**

### The Story You Need to Know

In 1972, Ted Brown - who moved from Harlem via Jamaica to Brixton where he still lives today - helped organize London's first Pride march on July 1st. One of the few Black people present, Brown organized the **kiss-in at Trafalgar Square** that preceded the march to Hyde Park, at a time when mainstream TV wouldn't air a same-sex kiss between men for another 17 years.

The Gay Liberation Front was directly influenced by **radical Black liberation organizing** - its founders Bob Mellor and Aubrey Walter met at the Revolutionary Peoples Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, convened by the Black Panther Party, where Huey Newton personally advocated for building common cause with movements for women's and gay liberation.

**A movement for queer liberation, intertwined in moral purpose and method with radical Black political organizing in the US, in which Black people were not only present, but prominent, was largely met with suspicion by campaigners for racial justice in the UK.**

### Why This Still Matters

Ted Brown isn't marching in 2022 to take a wistful trip down memory lane. He's launching a **campaign for dignity in care for LGBT elders** after his partner suffered harrowing homophobic elder abuse in a care home during the twilight of his life.

The article documents how racial justice organizations remained silent on Section 28, ambivalent on equalizing age of consent, and absent when we lost Justin Fashanu. It explores the trauma caused when Black queer people are told their liberation has to wait.

**This is the history we're building from.** This is why BLKOUT exists.

## 🏳️‍🌈 Community Updates

### Pride in London: Solidarity with Chris

We stand in unwavering solidarity with Chris and all those fighting to ensure Pride remains a space that **centers the most marginalized** in our community.

Pride is protest. Pride is political. Pride belongs to those who fought for it - and who still fight today.

As our "Counted As Warriors?" article reminds us: 50 years after that first march, we're still fighting to be counted. Still demanding that movements for racial justice recognize that **none of us are free until we are all free.**

### Congratulations Lady Phyll! 💍

Huge congratulations to **Lady Phyll** on her engagement!

Your decades of leadership through UK Black Pride, your unapologetic activism, and your commitment to Black queer liberation continue to inspire generations. You've created spaces where we can weep and still be counted as warriors.

Wishing you and your partner all the love, joy, and celebration you deserve.

## 🧠 Men's Health Month: Connection IS Health

November is Men's Health Month (Movember), and we're having real conversations about the health issues that actually affect Black queer men.

**Mental health. Physical health. Sexual health. Community health.**

### The Health Benefits of Connection

Here's what the research shows: **social connection is one of the strongest predictors of mental and physical health outcomes.** Not gym memberships. Not wellness apps. Connection.

Meaningful relationships and genuine community support:
- **Reduce depression and anxiety by up to 50%**
- **Lower risk of heart disease and strengthen immune function**
- **Increase lifespan** - social isolation is as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day
- **Build resilience** to navigate trauma and systemic violence

This is why we keep saying: **community isn't optional. It's survival.**
