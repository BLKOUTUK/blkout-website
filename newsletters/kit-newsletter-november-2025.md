# BLKOUT Community Newsletter - November 2025

## "Sit down and weep, and still be counted as warriors"

Brothers,

> *"no person, trying to take responsibility for her or his identity, should have to be so alone. There must be those among whom we can sit down and weep, and still be counted as warriors."*
> — Adrienne Rich

We created the BLKOUT platform as **a space for us to think, shout, show off, curse, celebrate, laugh, reflect and share.** Our own space to hear and be heard, beyond the empty rhetoric of 'representation' or 'clout'. Black queer men, if you've got something you want to say to other Black queer men, this is the platform.

This month, I want to highlight why our **Community Story Submission** feature matters - and it connects directly to a piece we published that every brother needs to read.

## 📖 Required Reading: "One Month Later: Are Pride's Anonymous Board Proud?"

**[READ: One Month Later - Pride's Anonymous Board →](https://voices-blkout.up.railway.app/#one-month-later-are-pride-s-anonymous-board-proud-mgmj86p2)**

*By Rob Berkeley | Published October 11, 2025*

This opinion piece examines what's happening at Pride in London one month after the board obtained a **High Court injunction against CEO Christopher Joell-DeShields** - and why every brother needs to understand this pattern.

### What's Actually Happening

Pride in London is operating with an **anonymous board** - no investigation findings, no transparency, despite spending substantial legal fees. An organization that receives public funding is acting like a private fiefdom, with board members making strategic media leaks while hiding their identities.

Christopher Joell-DeShields, the CEO, had successfully **transformed Pride to reflect London's actual demographic diversity**. He was doing the work. Making Pride actually representative. And then came the allegations, the injunction, the public spectacle.

### The Pattern We Know Too Well

As Rob Berkeley writes: **"Black leaders—especially Black gay leaders—recruited during crisis, set up to fail, then publicly executed when they succeed."**

Sound familiar? It should. We've seen this play out over and over:
- Recruit a Black leader during organizational crisis
- Watch them successfully transform the organization
- Resist the actual change they bring
- Remove them publicly while maintaining anonymity
- Claim progress while preventing transformation

This isn't just about one CEO. This is about how institutions resist genuine change while maintaining appearances of inclusivity.

### What This Means For Us

50 years after Ted Brown organized that kiss-in at Trafalgar Square, 50 years after the Gay Liberation Front learned from the Black Panthers that none of us are free until we are all free - **we're still watching Black queer leaders get publicly executed by anonymous boards.**

The article calls for Mayor Sadiq Khan to **"demand the transparency that public money should guarantee"** and ends with a direct challenge to the Pride in London board:

**"Show your faces. Share your findings. Or step aside and let people with actual courage lead."**

### Context: Read "Counted As Warriors?"

To understand the 50-year history this builds on, read Rob Berkeley's **["Counted As Warriors?"](https://blkoutuk.com/long-read-counted-as-warriors/)** - about Ted Brown, the first Pride march, the Black Panthers' influence on GLF, and 50 years of movements for racial justice failing to stand with Black queer people.

## 🏳️‍🌈 Community Updates

### Pride in London: Solidarity with Christopher Joell-DeShields

We stand in unwavering solidarity with **Christopher Joell-DeShields** and all those fighting to ensure Pride remains a space that **centers the most marginalized** in our community, not anonymous boards operating like private fiefdoms.

Christopher transformed Pride in London to reflect the city's actual demographic diversity. He was recruited to lead during crisis, succeeded in his mandate, and now faces a High Court injunction from a board that won't show their faces or share their findings.

**This is the pattern.** Black leaders - especially Black gay leaders - set up to fail, then publicly executed when they succeed.

Pride is protest. Pride is political. Pride belongs to those who fought for it - Ted Brown at Trafalgar Square, the GLF learning from the Black Panthers - not to anonymous boards resisting genuine change.

## 🧠 Men's Health Month: Connection IS Health

November is Men's Health Month (Movember), and we're having real conversations about the health issues that actually affect Black queer men.

**Mental health. Physical health. Sexual health. Community health.**

### The Health Benefits of Connection

Here's what the research shows: **social connection is one of the strongest predictors of mental and physical health outcomes.** Not gym memberships. Not wellness apps. Connection.

Meaningful relationships and genuine community support:
- **Reduce depression and anxiety by up to 50%**
- **Lower risk of heart disease and strengthen immune function**
- **Increase lifespan** - social isolation is as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day
- **Build resilience** to navigate trauma and systemic violence

This is why we keep saying: **community isn't optional. It's survival.**
