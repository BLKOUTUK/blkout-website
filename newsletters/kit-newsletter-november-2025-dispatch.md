# "Show your faces. Or step aside and let people with actual courage lead."

Brothers,

> *"no person, trying to take responsibility for her or his identity, should have to be so alone. There must be those among whom we can sit down and weep, and still be counted as warriors."*
> — Adrienne Rich

This month, we need to talk about what's happening at Pride in London - and the pattern every Black queer man should recognize.

## Required Reading: "One Month Later"

**[Read on BLKOUT Voices](https://voices-blkout.up.railway.app/#one-month-later-are-pride-s-anonymous-board-proud-mgmj86p2)**

*By Rob Berkeley | October 11, 2025*

One month after Pride in London's board obtained a High Court injunction against CEO Christopher Joell-DeShields, the board remains anonymous. No investigation findings. No transparency. Just strategic media leaks from people who won't show their faces.

Christopher successfully transformed Pride to reflect London's actual demographic diversity. Then came the allegations, the injunction, the public spectacle.

Rob Berkeley names the pattern: **"Black leaders—especially Black gay leaders—recruited during crisis, set up to fail, then publicly executed when they succeed."**

50 years after Ted Brown and the GLF learned from the Black Panthers that none of us are free until we are all free - we're still watching this play out.

The article ends with a challenge to the board and a call for Mayor Sadiq Khan to demand transparency.

**This is the pattern. You need to understand it.**

## Men's Health Month: Connection IS Health

November is Movember. Social connection reduces depression and anxiety by up to 50%, lowers heart disease risk, and increases lifespan. Social isolation is as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

**Community isn't optional. It's survival.**
