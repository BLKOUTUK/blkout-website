Thanks to the indefatigable efforts of <a href=\"https://lgbtplushistorymonth.co.uk/\">Schools Out</a> and interventions from an army of volunteers, amateur and professional historians, teachers, and social justice activists, LGBTQ History Month has become embedded in the national calendar. The fortunate coincidence with Black History Month in the US, has led to our timelines being replete with imagery and access to powerful storytelling about both Black and LGBTQ pasts. However, there remains work to do to join the dots, so that we can resist the erasure of Black folk from LGBTQ histories, and LGBTQ folk from Black histories.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:51% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><video controls src=\"https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/black-history-is-queer-history-Instagram-Post.mp4\"></video></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>The reticence to include Cecil Belfield-Clarke&#8217;s sexual orientation in celebration of his life and contribution to Black and Black British histories is an example of the tendency to erasure of difference in the name of &#8216;unity&#8217;. Such erasure tells us as much about past attitudes to LGBTQ inclusion, as it does about current patterns of silence and fear that continue to leave Black queer lives &#8216;unspoken&#8217; across much of the UK&#8217;s Black-led civil society organising.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As Audre Lorde reminds us in her magisterial paper, &#8216;Learning from the 1960s&#8217;, these are &#8216;teachable moments&#8217;;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Through examining the combination of our triumphs and errors, we can examine the dangers of an incomplete vision.

Our focus has been on four people with whom regular readers of this blog will be familiar. Chosen from among numerous remarkable Black LGBTQ people that have built Black, Queer, and Blaqueer networks; those whose experiences have reflected the spirit of their times, and who offer us inspiration for &#8220;possible futures&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Ivor Cummings</strong> &#8211;

More can be done to turn this intention into reality.&nbsp;<em>A Strange Loop</em>, is a significant work that, understood as part of a wider cultural turn, could have impact on the ways in which we address the systemic and structural patterns of discrimination and disadvantage faced by Black queer people. However, if we do not nurture spaces for dialogue between Black queer folk, the chances of creating shared meaning or shared action are minimal. Further, the chances of making connections between significant voices/art/works, raising our ambition to exercise our critical lens beyond that which can be addressed by the beauty-contest panel of influencers grateful for the clicks, and that someone (anyone?) noticed our existence, or taking steps towards shaping a movement grounded in Black queer experiences, are made ever more remote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-link-color wp-elements-191c5b880c1b6c611b1c7e81b69838ad\">Connecting <em>A Strange Loop</em> beyond theatre to television e.g. Donald Glover’s <em>Atlanta</em>, Janine Nabers&#8217; <em>Swarm</em> and <em>Watchmen</em>, Boots Riley’s <em>I’m a Virgo</em> (Michael R Jackson wrote an episode and co-produced the series about a giant Black teen), Terence Nance’s <em>Random Acts of Flyness, </em>or to literature e.g. JK Chukwu (<em>The Unfortunates</em>), Janelle Monae (<em>The Memory Librarian</em>), or Rasheed Newson (<em>My Government Means To Kill Me</em>) suggests we are witnessing a new wave of Afro surrealist thought that question the neo-liberal approaches that have promised so much, yet delivered so little towards Black liberation. These auteurs are often as critical of Tyler Perry&#8217;s approach as Michael R Jackson. There are even connections to be found under the same roof as the performances of <em>A Strange Loop &#8211; </em>with the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/CarrieMaeWeems\" target=\"_blank\">Carrie Mae Weems’ exhibition</a> work at the Barbican this summer, as well as with the fate of the dismantled Resonance Collective’s exhibition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noting these resonances and connections make even more evident the folly of hanging our hopes for liberation on visibility alone.

Usher returns to where he started, to declare, ‘<em>my only problem is with the pronoun ‘I’</em>&nbsp;‘. Michael R Jackson’s attention to detail as a writer enjoins us to take each couplet seriously, particularly in the final song of the show. Is Usher’s ultimate tragedy that he internalises his challenges, that he seeks to find all the answers within himself?

The kind of ‘overnight success’ that belies years of financial struggle, innovation driven by necessity as much as creativity, a series of false dawns, and the tragedy of squandered talent. Success is revealing itself through storytelling that demands to be heard, and stories that need to be told. The pandemic that caused a near terminal hiatus in theatregoing, alongside the public reaffirmation of (and cynical backlash against) anti-racism as a more-than-minority concern, appears to have finally turned years of empty rhetoric into action among some cultural gatekeepers.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"font-size:clamp(14px, 0.875rem + ((1vw - 3.2px) * 0.682), 20px);grid-template-columns:30% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"686\" src=\"https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-27560 size-full\" srcset=\"https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1.png 600w, https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1-262x300.png 262w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Black theatre performers, writers, producers – and crucially audiences – have begun to rebalance the fare on offer away from the fringe, onto West End stages. Sometimes, as is the case with Michael R Jackson’s,&nbsp;<em>A Strange Loop</em>, the musical delighting/challenging audiences at London’s Barbican Centre until 9 Sept 2023, this counterweight arrives pre-garlanded with Pulitzer Prize (2020), smash-hit Broadway debut (2022), and with Tony Awards for Best Musical and Best Book of a Musical in tow.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Charting one man’s journey to selfhood, Jackson’s musical recounts the tale of Usher, a Black queer everyman writing a musical about a Black queer man writing a musical about a Black queer man.&nbsp;So far, so loopy. <em>A Strange Loop</em>&nbsp;does what great theatre can – connects its audience to the humanity of a protagonist, and through them, helps us to see our own humanity in a different light. Who even knew that an &#8216;everyman&#8217; could ‘<em>travel the world in a fat, Black, queer body’? </em>Boundaries broken, this would be<em> a</em>chievement enough for most.&nbsp;<em>A Strange Loop</em>&nbsp;may also have rescued musical theatre from its Disneyfication or descent into horror (how else would the <em>Take That</em> jukebox musical and Gary-Barlow-fest destined for London in 2024, be described?) &#8211; saving musical theatre for a whole new generation (<em>’I should know I’m secretary of the Sondheim Society!’</em>, as one of Usher’s thoughts declares).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the book painstakingly crafted and closely scripted, through Usher, Jackson is able to present the dilemmas confronted when writing an avowedly Black queer play, thankfully rejecting the ‘<em>not a Black queer play, merely a play about Black queer character…</em>’ sidestep, that is so often used that it can feel like a slap in the face to those who share the identity downplayed, those seeking community and keen to see more diverse representation, so that they can see something of themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jackson’s device of embodying our hero&#8217;s competing thoughts as a (highly entertaining) chorus, allows Usher&#8217;s unreliable character to grapple with complexity in a manner many of us who operate within systems/structures that also oppress us, will recognise. Usher both rejects and embraces family, church, queerness, and identity as routes to and constraints upon freedom. In this way, he avoids the glib denial of the relevance of being in community, that is associated with conservative Black voices. Usher can recognise his need for intimacy without judgement, while running the gauntlet of judgement by using, &#8216;<em>no fats, no femmes, no Blacks</em>&#8216; dating apps to hook up. He resists stumbling into the Tyler Perry trap (as Usher defines it) of colluding with limiting stereotypes in order to commodify his identity, while seeking professional success by writing a play about his own identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In traversing Usher’s ‘strange loop’ of self-consciousness/conscious selfdom, we witness the attraction, delusion, and tragedy of fixity, the trauma revisited via ‘hate-the-sin-love-the-sinner’ compromise, and how abuse, racism and emotional violence is interwoven into Usher’s life in which</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong><em>He has to fight for his right/ To live in a world that chews up/ And spits out/ Black queers on the daily.</em></strong></p>\n<cite>&#8216;<em>Intermission</em>&#8216; A Strange Loop</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Usher is pushed to the edge of sanity by his efforts not to despair in the face of these challenges. We discover, with Usher, that if he is willing to confront his demons, there is hope of a way through, instead of his hopes for a way over; a way that, in keeping with the play’s solo character, can only have one hero.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-235acb0dc934b6e0d89766948f28addf\">Rarely, has the content of a play felt so challenging. Despite the fact that I have squirmed, sobbed, or been outraged in many auditorium seats over the years. From conversations I’ve been having with several Black queer men via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blkoutuk.com/blkouthub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BLKOUTHUB</a>&nbsp;and more broadly, it seems that I am not alone in this experience when viewing <em>A Strange Loop</em>. I had to supress the urge to clutch my proverbial pearls at certain points. The combination of the heartbreaking truths shared so relentlessly, and the dissonance resulting from the catchy tunes used to recount painful stories, landed with the impact intended by the writer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I then found myself concerned about what the largely white, straight Barbican theatre audience would make of it. There were times when the hearty applause, or guffaws of laughter from fellow (white) audience members felt inappropriate. Jackson’s intense writing rhythm means you are never far from a joke inserted to leaven the pain, and as my heart sank in recognition of shared pain, laughter at another humorous conceit, knowing reference, or clever word-play started to rile me. I am lucky to have the privilege of working with and for Black queer men. The pattern of acerbic, gallows humour, employed to avoid and obscure, represented an all too familiar loop. I have had the rarely afforded luxury of learning alongside my peers to own and celebrate difference without apology, asking for neither forgiveness nor permission. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to recognise my privilege, ignore the noises-off, and to reject the urge to avoid facing the difficult elements of Black queer life. I was challenged by this musical because it cut through even my struggle-weary cynicism, middle-aged&nbsp;<em>seen-it-all-beforeism. </em>My assumptions need to be challenged,&nbsp;<em>my</em>&nbsp;empathy muscles also require exercise. Often, even when Black queer experience is centred, the messages are designed for the benefit of those around us. So rare to feel directly addressed by a work, it is unsurprising that I was surprised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone I have spoken to about the play reached the same conclusions. Some reported that emotions stirred by Jackson’s unflinching honesty (even when delivered via Usher’s flinching personality traits and avoidance tactics) left them feeling uncomfortable. Their discomfort compounded by feeling exposed and vulnerable, and at the same time, ‘clocked’ by a largely white audience. Jackson’s rapier swipes at the heart of anyone who has defied convention and risked social rejection to take steps towards life outside of the majoritarian social norms &#8211; evoking the fear of &#8216;<em>hearing the people you loved say ‘I told you so’ &#8216; &#8211;</em> understandably left some with wigs well and truly snatched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I received one report of a young Black queer man leaving at a midpoint in the play – not an easy task when there is no interval, and when the Barbican stalls have sliding doors at the end of each row to keep the audience in &#8211; but for them enough was enough!</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong><em>did you see </em>A Strange Loop<em>?

Despite widespread general agreement that increased visibility of minoritised groups is welcome, (that it makes ‘a business case’ to set diversity quotas, and then downgrade them to ‘targets’ on failing to fill them) it is only when applied to a particular group – in this case, Black queer men – that crucial, critical secondary questions are asked.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-link-color wp-elements-a6e8e8362d203e2a24d00cfcae9480e8 is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong><em>We say ‘representation matters,’ but we rarely ask: to whom?

Encouraging us to face these issues is Jackson&#8217;s purpose here; with the theme of representation at the core of his concerns. Tempting as it might be to jeer, ‘snowflake’, or to reject these concerns about what others may think, as a hangover from Cosby-era, respectability politics. Instead, we might seek to understand how the vulnerability inherent in visibility is lived.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-link-color wp-elements-00c9fa343b8369c1d349ed17f6e809df\">Visibility is not always, or unequivocally, positive. Ask the young Black men of London about being seen. Is visibility liberating or oppressive to those teenagers wearing masks and hoods to avoid being tracked through the City’s ubiquitous CCTV? In common with their father’s generation, young black men in our capital remain <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/crime-justice-and-the-law/policing/stop-and-search/latest#by-ethnicity-over-time-to-2019\" target=\"_blank\">seven times more likely than their white peers</a> to be stopped and searched by the police? Is it dismissive of their concerns to opine,&nbsp;<em>‘lives are at stake, your distress is worthwhile</em>’? Is there a duty of care incumbent on the artist? Is it okay to disregard Black queer trauma, or calculate it as a price worth paying in order to provoke reaction or extend ratings? Or was James Baldwin, as long ago as 1969, right to question whether <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1969/02/02/archives/the-price-may-be-too-high.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Price May be Too High</em></a>? Should producers find ways to disrupt the structural context in which their stories are told, or is it enough to rely on the dynamics of debate in the &#8216;public square&#8217; to simply comment and move on to the next piece?</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-link-color wp-elements-f8688463aa2cbf4942af7164e9e55c05\">This is not a demand for artists to become politicians, or even to adopt the role of community organisers, but rather to be hold space for the marginalised, to be intentional about the inequalities present in the public sphere that are likely to shape the dialogue generated by their work. The innovation of the past year in London theatre, inspired by practice instigated by Jeremy O. Harris on Broadway, is the ‘<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://blackoutnite.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Blackout Performance</a>’. Similar in name and mission to BLKOUT, these performances centre and celebrate the role of Black audiences as well as creatives, interrupt the ubiquity of the white gaze, and contribute to anti-racist and/or pro-Black movement building.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>‘Artists are here to disturb the peace.’</strong></p>\n<cite>James Baldwin</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Our vice, if there is one worth identifying here, appears to be magical thinking.

Did you opt for one of the three extra dates at Spurs? Or will you be spending the night in the Welsh capital to see Queen Bey? I know interest rates went up again last week, and everything seems pricey. Inflation is in double digits. The UK narrowly dodging recession is scant comfort to the striking nurses, teachers, and other public service workers, but even among their ranks there will be those who understand that <strong><em>Beyonce Joy</em></strong> (c) is priceless. I know him indoors succeeded in talking you down from buying those £1960 front row seats &#8211; forget this winter&#8217;s cost-of-living <em>heating-v-eating</em> dilemmas, is the culture ready for summer&#8217;s <em>front-row- access-to-Beyonce Joy (c) v the stress of moving back in with your long-suffering parents for a few months</em> conundrum!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is sorely tempting to mock the BeyHive. Such unswerving dedication to their multi-millionaire muse and queen feels unsuited to the precarity of modern celebrity, the rarefied existence of those on the other side of the velvet rope represents a poor guarantee of ongoing relevance as their memory of relatable normalcy fades. The speed at which the pendulum of social taste swings away from an artist deemed to lack authenticity, plus a bank balance so comfort-inducing as to disincentivise leaving whichever gold plated mansion it is this season, must lead this superpower couple to consider hanging up their mics, leaving the BeyHive queenless and the hive &#8220;doomed&#8221; (*according to &#8216;Beekeeping for Dummies, in any case). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While sorely tempting to mock, it would be foolhardy. The Hive is widely recognised as &#8216;having no chill&#8217;. Paradigmatically, when enraged they enter battle with the abandon of death or dishonour kamikaze. Pop fandom has rarely, if ever, been known for encouraging measured or sensible acts of dispassionate music appreciation. This seems particularly true at this moment of peak clickbait, when the playbook of punk-style, artist histrionics, is too cliche to garner much popular interest. Immersive, on-demand media, collide with publics required to parse as many as ten thousand adverts each day (up from &#8216;only&#8217; 500 fifty years ago). Pop music, the most enduring of faddish, derivative, low-art forms responds in kind as it must, facilitating fickle acts of devotion that signify about as much as Harry Styles in a pussy bow shirt, that is to say, simultaneously not very much <em>and</em> everything (for an infinitesimally short time). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Beyonce, returning to our shores five years after her last blockbuster tour. Five years in which it feels like we have squeezed ten in terms of political, cultural and social change. Her last shows celebrated the (business, musical, and marital) partnership between Mr and Mrs -Z. This tour is different, because it is based on celebrating difference; it is <em>The Renaissance World Tour</em>. Guncle Johnny has been identified as the artist&#8217;s inspiration for the collection. Her use of wise counsel and megastar status secured the collaborations that enliven the tracks, authenticate her invitation to the queer corner of the cook-out, and share (some of) the wealth. Beyonce will be championing US Black queer folk and the cultures they have created across continents. We understand the attraction (and regularly do the same). We appreciate the political optics, and welcome solidarity that will extend beyond the entertainment mogul elites and enable space for more of <em>those</em> necessary conversations between Black people. (<em>I think click finger applause is an appropriate response</em>)</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-coblocks-gif wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://media4.giphy.com/media/DaqVwpzDfs7D2/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"546\" height=\"412\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The personal is political when populist governments (even populists as unpopular as our own) seek to &#8216;take back control&#8217; for super rich, patriarchal, and/or fascist elites, using black, brown and queer bodies as collateral damage in their efforts to distract a fearful public from the actual causes of dysfunctional government, increased fear of violent crime, the removal of hard won human rights, limitations on access to decent public services, meaningful jobs, and declining international influence. We are Black Britons so understand all too well that the margins can shape mainstream cultures, while being denied access to power. We&#8217;ve appeared in the promotional material more often than the boardroom. We have lived and re-lived the colonial playbook that systemically maintains privilege for the already privileged and tries to convince us that even our own senses are not to be trusted. We are asked to rely on x-ray vision to verify whether others have a racist/patriarchal/homophobic/sexist &#8216;bone in their body&#8217; (an accusation I am yet to hear anyone make despite the frequent use of its denial). Mainstream cultures initially revile the creative spark of black people, queer people or poor people that are in themselves driven by necessity, and derived from an ability to find abundance in scarcity &#8211; elements that denote the elusive &#8216;cool&#8217; sought by the culture vultures.  &#8216;Fetishise, patronise, monetise, bastardise&#8230;&#8217;, the recipe continues until finally, seek to invisiblise the contribution of those deemed marginal to anything of value, or claim it was derived from the powerful group all along (step forward government minster nominally &#8216;for Equalities&#8217; who responded to parliament&#8217;s Black History Month debate in 2020 with the dismissive, &#8216;We do not want teachers to teach their white pupils about white privilege and inherited racial guilt&#8217;)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inured to this pattern, confident in our tenacity to survive, our ability to imagine better futures, and alive to the requirement to build solidarity against oppression, we will adapt and continue to create.

When Queen Bey retires to her counting house to count her coin, we won&#8217;t be invited to take a percentage as profit for our dancefloor sweat equity. Nor will there be any offer of financial recompense for those years of storage and maintenance of the vibe that she has co-opted to pay for Blue Ivy to sail into the Ivy League. Like the unpaid intern in the arts or media, we may enjoy the experience, even learn from it, while at the same time be no better off as a result. Worse than the hapless intern, we&#8217;ll be found applauding the wit and wisdom of the premier couple of entertainment capitalism, having fuelled them with content in exchange for what? Visibility? Being seen by strangers is an acquired taste, and not a uniformly positive one without voice or assurance of safety. Whether you revel in the (reflected) limelight, or shrink from the glare of the anglepoise in the interrogation room, visibility butters few parsnips. The richest in the stadium &#8216;get rich&#8217;, while we face the prospect of hustling even harder to pay the credit card bills for trains to-, and hotels in Cardiff; still <em>trying</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyonce is remarkable, but is not (yet) able to operate outside of time, beyond capitalism, or without political backlash. She is not the first pop megastar though. There have been precedents, in the not-so-distant past. In 1990, Madonna took &#8216;<em>the gays</em>&#8216; mainstream. So pleased was she with the good she had done, and the ground broken, she was persuaded by film director, Alek Keshishian, to make a self-congratulatory, yet highly regarded documentary, said to contain the seeds of inspiration for the reality TV revolution &#8211;<em> In Bed With Madonna / Madonna: Truth or Dare</em> (US Title) &#8211; as a result. The film, premiered alongside the Cannes film Festival in 1991, and remained the highest grossing documentary until 2002. Along with<em> Paris Is Burning</em> (1990), the film amplified the voices of queer people, and changed the conversation significantly.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Strike a pose | Documentary 2016 -- gay themed [Full HD Trailer]\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MYYNaafGKww?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither <em>Paris Is Burning</em> nor <em>Truth or Dare</em> would be made now, but for the first half of the 1990s these were important interventions in the struggle for LGBTQ rights. When documentaries require documentaries, you know that somewhere there has been beef. In this case, after the film&#8217;s release, a number of the dancers sued Madonna and the filmmaker for outing them, and endangering their careers as a result &#8211; media visibility may have been great for the movement, but less so perhaps for its protagonists or their potential employers. What are movements, if not people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Strike A Pose</em> was made to reflect on the 25 years since the release of the popular, <em>In Bed with Madonna/ Madonna: Truth or Dare</em>. 25 years is not too long for some to bear a grudge; the load changes the carrier though.

At our modest age we have gained some insights from observation and employing emergent strategies &#8211; firstly, the value of making our intentions clear when building coalitions and partnerships. Secondly, the power of establishing patterns/ways of working at the most intimate levels that can scale to inform the shape of the intermediate, immense, and ultimately, the infinite. We also know that what we pay attention to grows. It follows, then, that for us, a Black Queer renaissance would include a focus on creating and sustaining spaces in which relationships of common interest and mutual benefit can flourish between Black queer folk, we start with men. It follows too, that those spaces and relationships will find support and sustenance in both digital and on-land environments. Finally, the interventions we may make centre the lives and experiences of a diverse range of Black queer men. Like Beyonce with her latest album, we set out to create spaces in which bravery is encouraged, and growth enabled, where judgements are held lightly, and joyfulness abounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Community-accelerator-outcomes-1-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-20798\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://blkoutuk.com/archives/20995\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"20995\">&#8216;community accelerator</a>&#8216; fundraising campaign seeks to bring an increased focus to our emergent model, and enable us to implement learnings from practice, while continuing to innovate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our initial approach on fundraising had been to seek a large multi-year grant, that would give us the chance to be part of driving transformative change and healing justice.

Activating our differences as the context for generative interdependence rather than as levers for destructive conflict runs counter to the way in which populists and identity essentialists have sought to frame trans lives, migrants, and black lives as somehow less deserving of trust, compassion, and love.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/12-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21217\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots is-style-dots--6\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>The attention that will be generated by Beyonce&#8217;s Renaissance World Tour (plus potential Glastonbury and/or a Netflix Special), contains risks but together we can take steps to protect our safety.

The enduring attraction of the city to the ready-to-cross-boundaries queer person. There are versions of this story as old as the city itself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The village life no longer satisfying, the youth sets out to &#8216;seek his fortune&#8217;. The tales of antiquity contain both warnings and encouragement, the youths are set upon by brigands, or bells ring out to toll, &#8216;<em>turn again</em>, <em>turn again</em>&#8216;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><em>Sexile</em>, is not just the student banished to the library or launderette while a roommate gets it on &#8211; reminder and incentive to get some of your own though that may be. Sexile is the journey of LGTBQ+ people from towns to cities, driven by discrimination and lack of acceptance, and attracted by the possibility of living in freedom and being themselves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>London, Manchester, Birmingham, Brighton, Bristol issue their siren call. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Few can resist. Black queer people are among the moths drawn towards the bright lights and underground shadows too. The folk who &#8216;<em>just geddit&#8217;</em> congregate in the urban sprawl where difference is normal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>People gather for the safety to be found in numbers, sometimes distancing for the same reason &#8211; camaraderie and anonymity in proportion to the day&#8217;s need. Communities of identity, such as LGBTQ+ communities or communities based on ethnicity or religion, do not necessarily have a geographical locus. This can be by choice; the stories we hold onto about gossip-prone social networks as risks to our ability to <em>control our story</em>; used to maintain &#8216;DL cover&#8217;, or to sustain the Janus-style myth that we are one person &#8216;in the streets,&#8217; and another &#8216;between the sheets&#8217;, are to be weighed against the necessary level of turnover in alluring avatars to scroll through in hope. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the reasons, complex or base as they may be, critical mass means that their concerns may not always be given the same level of attention or recognition as communities defined by place. This can create serious challenges for these communities in terms of finding support, resources, and a sense of belonging. This is true for those who may know the city well through different lens, or (given the increasing amount of time we spend of our lives in multi generational households), for whom being a <em>sexile</em> proves impossible, whose move therefore has been more of perspective than postcode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"She, un cuento de J&amp;B\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LEshVJ1IECw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A Christmas Story for 2023, for us?</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of ways that communities of identity can be included and recognized, even when communities defined by place are given precedence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One approach is for these communities to advocate for themselves and make their voices heard, either through grassroots organizing, lobbying, or other forms of activism. This can involve working with community members, as well as engaging with policy makers and decision makers to ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, allies within communities defined by place are tasked with work to support and uplift the voices and experiences of those from communities of identity. This can involve speaking out against discrimination and prejudice, listening to the ways in which the minoritized are framing their experiences, and working to create inclusive and welcoming environments for all members of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>BLKOUT seeks to work with our members, peers, and partners where they are, rather than where we may wish they have got to.

      "content": "\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On the 7th October 2022, Antoine D Craigwell will open the 8th <em>&#8216;In My Mind Conference&#8217;</em> on the mental health and wellness of LGBTQ+ People of Colour. This year, the focus is on older SGL people. The theme was chosen intentionally around tenacity and &#8216;agelessness&#8217; of healing.</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Unwilling to countenance risking the health of his target group to a resurgence of COVID-19, Craigwell,  journalist and film producer-turned-advocate for Black gay men&#8217;s mental health, took an early decision to host the conference online, as well as via smaller satellite gatherings across New York. Smaller gatherings are easier to manage in ways that minimise any viral transmission.  At the same time, &#8216;smaller&#8217; means the event is experienced at the more human scale many of the community members he is seeking to attract will prefer. Local partners/hosts will be encouraged to lean in and extend the conversations among their colleagues and users/clients. It will also save him and his team from setting out to close the digital divide one Zoom user at a time. He suspects the long periods of lockdown in NYC were made even more challenging for some older SGL People of Colour due to a lack of familiarity with digital comms platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the conference planning team, excluding this group from participation would have been unthinkable. They are the stars of the show, their knowledge of their own situation is <em>the</em> highly valuable, expert knowledge.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-right has-red-color has-text-color\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-weight:600\"><blockquote><p>These are our “silent” community members, who find themselves relegated to the margins, to the shadows. . . we are focusing on our community members who possess a wealth of knowledge and experience, with achievements and mistakes, joys and sorrows, and more importantly, the resilience they’ve built and reinforced with each passing year, with each life event.</p><cite>https://inmymindconference.com/theme</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The indigenous, inherited, and ancestral, have taken a more prominent place in the work of DBGM, the conference organisers whose work Craigwell leads.

They were on a high from having just completed London’s first ‘Gay Pride’ March. They had been inspired by the movement that had coalesced around demands for an end to police brutality, after years of raids on the Stonewall Inn, New York, just three years earlier. Though the more significant influence on their thinking seems to be the <a href=\"https://revolution.berkeley.edu/projects/rainbow-sign/\">West Coast ‘hippy’ radicalism</a> of Berkeley, Oakland and San Francisco. Between 500 and 2000 people are estimated to have taken part in some aspect of the day of protest, organised by the committee of under-21s of the Gay Liberation Front. The decriminalisation of homosexuality, ‘won’ five years earlier, had not applied to adults under 21; the GLF believed in those most impacted taking the lead. A young Ted Brown, an early and an enthusiastic member of the GLF was tasked with organising the Trafalgar Square ‘kiss-in’ that preceded the march to the Hyde Park party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6988c8bd5ad784f43d6e476fb37495bb\"><a href=\"https://libcom.org/article/brief-history-gay-liberation-front-1970-73\">The GLF London,</a> was less than two years on from its first meeting at the London School of Economics. It would disband a year later &#8211; shining brightly but briefly. Perhaps this was inevitable, for a group seeking to resist (re)creating oppressive hierarchies. They had begun the process of movement-building, articulating demands, agitating for change, drawing directly from the organising playbook of <a href=\"https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/pwh/glf-london.asp\">radical Black liberation</a>. Bob Mellor and Aubrey Walter, the GLF’s founders, had met at <em>the Revolutionary Peoples Constitutional Convention</em> in Philadelphia. The event, convened by the Black Panther Party, heard Huey Newton, advocate in person for his strategy of building common cause with movements for women’s and gay liberation. In doing so, he directly challenged homophobia and violence, locating the problem with heterosexual men’s ‘insecurities’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-cb9d47f3d30bea36f617128f4cf221e3\">In his teen years, Ted Brown, moved from Harlem, via Jamaica, to Brixton, where he still lives today. He helped to organise London&#8217;s first Pride March on July 1st, 1972. One of few Black people present, Brown described the day as ‘amazing’, in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/apr/08/ted-brown-the-man-who-held-a-masskiss-in-and-made-history\">recent interview </a>for <em>The Guardian</em>. Remarkably, he is making plans to attend an anniversary march being organised by a revived GLF, 50 years after the first. He will be marching not to take a wistful trip down memory lane, but to launch a new campaign in response to harrowing, homophobic elder abuse suffered by his partner in a care home during the twilight of his life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 46%\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-luminous-vivid-amber-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-bdd8ffa4a994b4b985968660865f72d4\"><em>Brown’s campaign is demanding assurances from regulators, and accountability on dignity in care for LGBT elders from care home proprietors. </em>  </p>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img data-dominant-color=\"6a6669\" data-has-transparency=\"false\" style=\"--dominant-color: #6a6669;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1020\" src=\"https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/imageedit_226_3975468252-1024x1020.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-27728 size-full not-transparent\" srcset=\"https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/imageedit_226_3975468252-1024x1020.webp 1024w, https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/imageedit_226_3975468252-400x398.webp 400w, https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/imageedit_226_3975468252-100x100.webp 100w, https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/imageedit_226_3975468252-768x765.webp 768w, https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/imageedit_226_3975468252-jpg.webp 1190w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0879678feec488865d3de4b6777ee43f\">Not yet born when Ted Brown orchestrated the kiss-in around Nelson’s column, I am full of admiration for him, and the efforts of so many of his generation who had to fight to live their lives, fight to love. Their bravery is even more remarkable because they fought without the luxury of knowing how it would all work out; without guarantee of eventual vindication. We must not forget how transgressive an act a ‘kiss-in’ was – it took another 17 years until mainstream TV aired<a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/videos/ian-mckellen-first-gay-kiss\"> a same sex kiss between men</a>. Piers Morgan, reporting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/29/michael-cashman-abuse-invisible-sign-eastenders\">The Sun in January 1989</a>, described that kiss as a ‘homosexual love scene between yuppie poofs’, adding a disingenuous concern for child welfare, ‘when millions of children were watching’. The ‘culture wars’ we currently experience rely on dog-whistles and coded epithets; LGBTQ Britons were not afforded even this fake politeness. The connection between hate speech and hate crime is well documented.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-left has-red-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"border-width:3px;margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);margin-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);margin-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);font-style:normal;font-weight:500\"><blockquote><p><em>A movement for queer liberation, intertwined in moral purpose and method with radical Black political organising in the US, in which Black people were not only present, but prominent, was largely met with suspicion by campaigners for racial justice in the UK. Active resistance towards solidarity, or benign neglect of allyship, or denialism of Black queer existence became the approach. The repercussions of the trauma caused goes largely unrecognised. The waste of talent and potential driven by suspicion of those identifying as both Black and queer, and the missteps that could have been avoided by choosing the side of the oppressed over the oppressor echo and reverberates across movements for racial justice, even today.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-79738b44a600ebbcec99a752d3801a10\">I ran my first racial equality focused charity in 1994 at the age of 20. I left the racial justice think-tank, Runnymede Trust, when I was 40, after a 5-year stint as its first Black director. 1994 was also the year in which I ‘came out’ as a gay man. I experienced my first Pride the following year, while volunteering as a ‘parade’ steward. I now work with bi, gay and/or trans men of African descent in the UK, to develop BLKOUTUK &#8211;<a href=\"http://For My Own Protection, Essex Hemphill https://youtu.be/OZyplIk1ztI\"> an organisation <em>‘to save our lives</em></a>’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a particularly English flavour to the lack of leadership, uncomfortable silences, and ‘polite’ avoidances that have typified a half century of non-responses to the needs of Black and brown queer Britons. Throughout the 90s and 00s there was next to zero intervention from racial justice organisations on behalf of queer people of colour. Section 28? – nothing. Equalising age of consent? – ambivalence. The army, same-sex couple adoption? The silence was deafening. The debate was left to the religiously dogmatic to argue with queer Black and Asian folk. Way to ally. This failure still needs to be addressed and atoned for among racial justice advocates here. The claims of a greater proximity to religious beliefs/practice as the fig leaf behind which to shelter, ring particularly hollow in hindsight. The visibility and challenge posed by queer leadership of Black Lives Matter in the US, posthumous awards given by President Obama to Bayard Rustin, or the rediscovery and re-presentation of James Baldwin&#8217;s writing, cannot be claimed as evidence of meaningful change in UK-based movements for racial justice by a mystical diasporan association. The blank looks I get today when I ask Black youth employment organisations, adolescent mental health interventions, or minority ethnic financial inclusion courses about the patterns of discrimination that impact on the Black queer people they work with, are testament to how far we have allowed heterosexual ‘insecurities’ about sexual identity to lead to worse services for Black queer people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There needs to be a reckoning with those parts of British movements for racial justice yet to acknowledge those times where the violence and harm wielded by our oppressors came to be understood as the lingua franca of struggle &#8211; as if liberation for some could ever truly be won at the expense of the further subjugation of others. Stand back if you are ‘too Black’, ‘too unconventional’, ‘too controversial’, ‘too queer’, your liberation can wait. Those thrown under the bus in the quest for the weak sauce of temporary tolerance are numerous – in exchange for this week’s favourable news coverage in a paper that will happily trash your work next week, or to look fashionable by siding with the teenage reggae artist (just because it’s a hot riddim that he demands your brother’s violent execution to). Ultimately, they would discover, in a lesson learned much too slowly, and at vast expense, it is only truth that sets you free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-3fe7f2456fe5718863dcb7146075dcab\">Movements for racial justice seemed to forget who they were there for, seeking respectability before justice. Using strictly ‘government names’, and employing their best ‘phone voices’, it is unsurprising that the distance between the experiences of Black and brown people and the organisations that claimed to represent them grew. A network of local race equality councils, youth movements and elders’ social clubs withered over these decades, as increasing numbers of people failed to recognise who they stood for. Offered opportunities to build common cause, for example via the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Murder_Music\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Murder_Music\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Stop Murder Music Campaign</em></a>, or at the untimely and tragic death of <a href=\"https://theface.com/society/for-justin-fashanu-tomorrow-never-came-first-and-only-openly-gay-black-footballer\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://theface.com/society/for-justin-fashanu-tomorrow-never-came-first-and-only-openly-gay-black-footballer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Justin Fashanu</a>, racial justice leaders remained missing in action, or worse chose to side with the oppressors. The impact was that Black and brown people were increasingly viewed as ‘socially conservative’ while literature, the fine arts, pop music, children’s television, PM David Cameron’s opportunistic, ideology-lite, ‘Chipping Snorton’ set, and even the English Defence League, vocalised support of queer rights, before many Black leaders seemed to get the memo.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized wp-duotone-midnight\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"700\" height=\"650\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px\" src=\"https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/imageedit_25_8642619579-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-22312\" style=\"width:524px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/imageedit_25_8642619579-1.png 700w, https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/imageedit_25_8642619579-1-300x279.png 300w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Too often missing in action in addressing sexism and homophobia, movements for racial justice lost out on the insights of Black queer people. We <em>are</em> currently victims of a &#8216;Jedi mind-trick&#8217; (just not the one Labour leader Kier Starmer has identified), where in the wake of the latest series of Black &#8216;lynchings&#8217; in the US during a global pandemic, the establishment talked up the prospect of a &#8216;racial reckoning&#8217;, and then, almost imperceptibly, shifted to discussing that same &#8216;reckoning&#8217; in the past tense, as if it happened and we missed it. All reasonable requests for accountability are subsequently met with a roll of the eyes or an exasperated sigh. &#8216;You&#8217;re obsessed! Not again, hadn&#8217;t we dealt with this already?&#8217; they remark, usurping the position of victim, and asking for mercy. Calling out racism &#8216;again&#8217;, is regarded as the action of a &#8216;bad sport&#8217;, or worse a self-serving liar whose demands ought to be disregarded.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-d110ddcf3bc2aa64c7766fb292060ea5\">One of the ‘joys’ of life at the intersections of homophobia/patriarchy and anti-Black racism is that both social forces generate similar avoidance tactics from those who believe they stand to gain from doing nothing to dismantle them. It is like having a mediocre poker player as opponent, the more hands you play, the more likely you are to spot their ‘tell’ &#8211; repetition makes recurring patterns far easier to spot. In unguarded moments, I’ve heard anti-racist leaders who should know better talk of a ‘Gay Agenda’, or reassure me that some of their best friends are homosexual, or declare envy at the progress of queer rights, in comparison to racial justice, as if there is only so much justice to go round, and a different oppressed group has taken progress that they were somehow entitled to – excusing the powerful from scrutiny. I’m wise to it now – and not just the actions of racial justice focused organisations; there is a parallel critique for LGBTQ organisations who see Black people solely as a threat; willing to use Black queer people as a tool with which to feed their<a href=\"http://www.whitepeoplewontsaveyou.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> racist ‘saviour complex’</a>, exempting Black queer folk, who they award a deracinated ‘pass’ and a portion of liberal pity, that they never asked for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-1f7e01da7546200140c583d78b264668\">At a recent overseas conference, among a highly impressive gathering of Black mental health advocates and innovators I found myself in floods of tears answering a question that I’d addressed numerous times in the past without the water works. On my mind were all my Black queer contemporaries who had only been served with excuses when action was necessary. Who, told that their liberation had to wait, decided that <a href=\"https://www.justlikeus.org/blog/2021/11/16/black-lgbt-young-people-covid-mental-health/\">they couldn’t wait</a>. In some throats were the standard accusations of queer deviance and disloyalty to the cause of racial justice. What made my tears flow, however, were a series of words I had heard too rarely. Words of unequivocal solidarity, of community, of determination to build our movements from actions and relationships that will be part of our new world, rather than those that replicate the violence of the old. Lockdown, my tears reminded me, had taken a lot out of me. Through those involuntary tears, however, I felt held by a community for the first time in a very long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am increasingly proud of the next generation of activists here in the UK who have grown up with the shorthand of memes and hashtags that so elegantly call out lazy thinking and are less forgiving of rank hypocrisy. Similarly, I’ve encountered some amazing minds from activists across the diaspora, who are building utopian queer communities, often in social contexts and regimes that threaten their lives. For too many Black queer people globally, a public kiss-in today would mean more than clutched pearls, or a series of strongly worded letters to the Telegraph. Despite 50 years of visible activity and inspiring campaigning here in a favourable social climate, we are yet to experience what the full inclusion of queer voices in Black and brown communities in the UK could deliver for the benefit of all. While it is great to see some of the work undertaken in the 80s and 90s being documented, we cannot yet forget or forgive those who failed to lead, and there must be a collective commitment to repair the damage done, and to learn from those mistakes, lest we repeat them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our aim, through BLKOUTUK, is to support the creation of digital and IRL spaces where Black queer people will be able to build those networks in which they will be able, in Adrienne Rich’s words, to </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote has-red-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background has-medium-font-size\" style=\"border-width:9px;font-style:normal;font-weight:600\"><blockquote><p>“sit down and weep, and still be counted as warriors”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-11 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" data-id=\"21738\" src=\"https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/weep-adrienne-rich-1-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21738\" style=\"border-width:12px\" srcset=\"https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/weep-adrienne-rich-1-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/weep-adrienne-rich-1-300x300.png 300w, https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/weep-adrienne-rich-1-150x150.png 150w, https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/weep-adrienne-rich-1-768x768.png 768w, https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/weep-adrienne-rich-1-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://blkoutuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/weep-adrienne-rich-1.png 2000w\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",
