## 🔍 Current System Audit Results

### ✅ **Functional Components**
- ✅ Website builds successfully
- ✅ Navigation system working
- ✅ Events calendar integration complete with yellow theme
- ✅ Component structure properly organized
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful

### ⚠️ **Issues Requiring Action**

#### **High Priority Issues:**

1. **IVOR Backend Connectivity**
   - Status: Backend not running
   - Impact: IVOR interface non-functional
   - Action: Install dependencies and start service
   - Files: `/home/robbe/BLKOUTNXT_Projects/ivor/ivor/backend/`

2. **Mock Data Dependencies**
   - Status: Multiple services using mock data
   - Impact: Non-functional features in production
   - Files affected:
     - `src/services/eventsService.ts` - Events mock data
     - `src/components/newsroom/NewsroomEnhanced.tsx` - Mock articles
     - `src/components/magazine/` - Mock magazine content
     - `src/components/community/` - Mock community data

3. **Welcome Video Display**
   - Status: Video file exists but display issues reported
   - File: `/images/squared/Finalfinalwelcome SQUARED.mp4`
   - Issue: Browser compatibility or rendering problems

4. **Liberation Pathway Quiz**
   - Status: Needs production readiness testing
   - Component: `src/components/blkout/EnhancedQuiz.tsx`
   - Critical: Core user journey functionality

#### **Medium Priority Issues:**

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Bundle size warnings (>500KB chunks)
   - Potential code splitting needed
   - Image optimization required

6. **Error Handling**
   - Need comprehensive error boundaries
   - API failure fallbacks
   - User feedback mechanisms
