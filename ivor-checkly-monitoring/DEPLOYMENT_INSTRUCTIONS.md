2. Sign up with your BLKOUT email
3. Choose **free plan** (10,000 check runs/month, perfect for beta)

## STEP 2: Get API Credentials (1 minute)

1. In Checkly dashboard, go to **Account Settings** > **API Keys**
2. Create new API key: "IVOR Monitoring"
3. Copy **Account ID** and **API Key**

```bash
cd /home/robbe/BLKOUTNXT_Projects/website/blkout-website/ivor-checkly-monitoring
checkly login
```

## STEP 4: Set Up Telegram Integration (Optional)

If you want Telegram alerts:

```bash
# Set environment variable
export CHECKLY_TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK="your_telegram_webhook_url"
```

## STEP 5: Test Configuration (1 minute)

checkly test
```

## STEP 6: Deploy to Production (30 seconds)

```bash
# Deploy all checks to Checkly cloud
checkly deploy
```

## STEP 7: Verify Deployment

1. Go to https://app.checklyhq.com/checks
2. You should see 5 checks:
   - âœ… IVOR System Disruptor Pathway Response
   - âœ… IVOR Community Healer Pathway Response  
   - âœ… IVOR Multi-Service Knowledge Query
   - âœ… IVOR API Gateway Health Check
   - âœ… IVOR Monitoring Dashboard Accessibility

## Expected Results After Deployment

### Immediate (within 5 minutes):
- All 5 checks running every 5 minutes
- Baseline performance metrics established
- Any failures immediately detected

### Short-term (within 1 hour):
- Performance trends visible
- Response time patterns established
- Service orchestration quality baseline

### Long-term (24 hours):
- Full performance profile
- Cascade failure pattern detection active
- Historical uptime tracking

## Monitoring Schedule

- **API Checks**: Every 5 minutes
- **Dashboard E2E**: Every 5 minutes  
- **Locations**: EU (London) + US (Virginia)
- **Alerting**: Immediate on any failure

## What This Monitors

### ðŸŽ¯ **Cascade Failure Prevention**
- Detects when IVOR services fall back too quickly
- Monitors response quality vs response time
- Alerts on orchestration breakdown

### ðŸ“Š **Service Orchestration Quality**
- Tests pathway-aware responses
- Verifies community-focused language
- Monitors cultural affirmation in responses

### âš¡ **Performance Monitoring**
- API response times
- Dashboard load performance
- Service availability

### ðŸš¨ **Alert Conditions**
- Any check failure â†’ Immediate alert
- Response time > 8 seconds â†’ Warning
- Fallback language detected â†’ Investigation needed

## Integration with Existing Monitoring

This **enhances** your current monitoring at https://ivor-monitoring-service.vercel.app/:

- **Your Dashboard**: Shows individual service health
- **Checkly**: Tests end-to-end user experience and orchestration quality
- **Combined**: Complete visibility into IVOR platform health

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
```bash
# Check authentication
checkly whoami

# Verify config
checkly test --dry-run
```

### If checks fail:
1. Check https://ivor-monitoring-service.vercel.app/
2. Test IVOR services manually:
   ```bash
   curl https://ivor-api-gateway-1yhe12lks-robs-projects-54d653d3.vercel.app/api/health
   ```

## Cost Information

- **Free tier**: 10,000 check runs/month
- **Our usage**: ~14,400 runs/month (5 checks Ã— 288 runs/day)
- **Recommendation**: Upgrade to Pro ($20/month) if needed

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. âœ… Monitor for 24 hours to establish baselines
2. âœ… Fine-tune alert thresholds based on actual performance
3. âœ… Add additional checks for specific user journeys if needed
