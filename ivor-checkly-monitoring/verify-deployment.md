## üìä Check for IVOR Monitoring

Look for these 3 checks in your dashboard:

### Expected Checks:
1. ‚úÖ **IVOR API Gateway Health**
   - URL: `https://ivor-api-gateway-1yhe12lks-robs-projects-54d653d3.vercel.app/health`
   - Frequency: Every 5 minutes
   - Location: EU West

2. ‚úÖ **IVOR Dashboard Health** 
   - URL: `https://ivor-monitoring-service.vercel.app/`
   - Frequency: Every 5 minutes
   - Location: EU West

3. ‚úÖ **IVOR Chat Response Quality**

## üîç What to Look For:

In your Checkly dashboard, you should see:
- **Checks tab**: Shows your 3 IVOR monitoring checks
- **Green status indicators**: All checks passing
- **Recent results**: First results within 5-10 minutes
- **Alert settings**: Email alerts configured

## ‚ùì If You Don't See the Checks:

The deployment might need to be completed. Do you see any checks in your dashboard, or is it empty?

## ‚úÖ Next Steps:

1. **If checks are visible**: Your IVOR monitoring is live! üéâ
2. **If dashboard is empty**: We'll need to re-run the deployment with fresh auth
3. **If some checks missing**: We can add the missing ones quickly
