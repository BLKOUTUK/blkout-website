# Workflow Summary:
# 1. Environment validation & dependency installation
# 2. Comprehensive production validation (critical)
# 3. Security scanning & vulnerability assessment
# 4. Build validation & performance checks
# 5. Mock data detection (deployment blocker)
# 6. Load testing for production deployments
# 7. Deployment readiness gate (go/no-go decision)
# 8. Conditional production deployment
# 9. Staging deployment (default)
# 10. Status notification & reporting

# This pipeline ensures:
# - No mock data reaches production
# - All security vulnerabilities are addressed
# - Performance meets acceptable standards
# - Build process is reliable and optimized
# - Comprehensive validation prevents the 35+ previous failures
