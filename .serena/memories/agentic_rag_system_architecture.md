# Agentic RAG System Architecture for BLKOUT Platform

## System Overview

The Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for BLKOUT will provide intelligent, autonomous content discovery, curation, and distribution focused on Black queer liberation, community events, and cooperative ownership initiatives.

## Core Architecture Principles

1. **Community-First Intelligence**: AI agents prioritize content that strengthens community bonds
2. **Cooperative Ownership**: Transparent algorithms with community oversight
3. **Black Queer Liberation Focus**: Content filtering and prioritization aligned with BLKOUT values
4. **Trust-Based Automation**: High-confidence auto-approval with human oversight for edge cases
5. **Digital Sovereignty**: Self-hosted solutions where possible, minimal dependency on corporate platforms

## System Architecture Components

### 1. Database Architecture

#### Vector Database (Primary Intelligence Layer)
- **Technology**: Pinecone or Weaviate (cloud) / ChromaDB (self-hosted)
- **Purpose**: Semantic content storage and similarity search
- **Data Structure**:
  - Content embeddings (1536-dimensional vectors)
  - Metadata: source, category, confidence score, community relevance
  - Tags: automated and community-generated
  - Temporal relevance scores

#### Traditional Database (Structured Data Layer)
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL with vector extensions (pgvector)
- **Purpose**: Structured data storage and relationships
- **Tables**:
  - `content_items` (events, articles, news, resources)
  - `sources` (websites, feeds, community submissions)
  - `categories` (events, activism, resources, news, community)
  - `tags` (automated and manual)
  - `approval_queue` (pending content review)
  - `user_interactions` (community feedback, relevance scores)
  - `scraping_jobs` (scheduling and status tracking)

#### Real-time Synchronization
- **Technology**: Event-driven architecture with Redis Pub/Sub
- **Purpose**: Ensure consistency between vector and relational data
- **Process**:
  1. Content ingested → PostgreSQL record created
  2. Content vectorized → Vector DB updated
  3. Event published → All services notified
  4. Cache invalidation → Fresh data served
