# BLKOUT Website - Emergency Rollback Procedures

## üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT FAILURE RESPONSE PLAN

**Purpose**: Prevent extended downtime and ensure rapid recovery from the 35+ previous deployment failures.

---

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE RESPONSE (0-5 minutes)

### 1. **STOP DEPLOYMENT IMMEDIATELY**
```bash
# If using Vercel
vercel --cancel

# If using Docker
docker-compose down
docker system prune -f

# If using CI/CD Pipeline
# Cancel all running deployment jobs immediately
```

### 2. **ACTIVATE MAINTENANCE MODE**
```bash
# Create maintenance page
echo "BLKOUT Community Platform - Temporary Maintenance" > maintenance.html
# Deploy maintenance page immediately
```

### 3. **ASSESS IMPACT SEVERITY**
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Site completely down (immediate rollback required)
- [ ] **HIGH**: Core functionality broken (rollback within 15 minutes)
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Some features broken (assess and fix within 1 hour)
- [ ] **LOW**: Minor issues (monitor and schedule fix)

---

## üîÑ ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### **Option A: Git-Based Rollback (Recommended)**

```bash
# 1. Identify last known good commit
git log --oneline -10
git show --stat [LAST_GOOD_COMMIT_HASH]

# 2. Create emergency rollback branch
git checkout -b emergency-rollback-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
git reset --hard [LAST_GOOD_COMMIT_HASH]

# 3. Force push to trigger redeployment
git push origin emergency-rollback-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S) --force

# 4. Update main branch pointer
git checkout main
git reset --hard [LAST_GOOD_COMMIT_HASH]
git push origin main --force
```

### **Option B: Backup-Based Rollback**

```bash
# 1. Restore from automated backup
cp -r ./backups/last-known-good/* ./

# 2. Restore environment configuration
cp ./backups/env/.env.production.backup ./.env.production

# 3. Rebuild and redeploy
npm install
npm run build
# Deploy using your preferred method
```

### **Option C: Container Rollback (Docker)**

```bash
# 1. Stop current containers
docker-compose down

# 2. Rollback to previous image
docker image ls blkout-website
docker tag blkout-website:previous blkout-website:latest

# 3. Restart with previous version
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Verify rollback success
curl -I http://localhost:3000/health
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è DAMAGE ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST

### **Critical Services Check**
```bash
# 1. Frontend availability
curl -I https://blkoutuk.com/
curl -I https://www.blkoutuk.com/

# 2. IVOR Backend status
curl -I https://ivor.blkoutuk.com/health

# 3. Events API status  
curl -I https://events.blkoutuk.com/api/health

# 4. Database connectivity
# Run database health check script
node ./scripts/check-database-health.js

# 5. CDN and asset delivery
curl -I https://blkoutuk.com/images/BLKOUT25INV.png
```

### **User Impact Assessment**
- [ ] **Community Access**: Can users reach the platform?
- [ ] **IVOR Functionality**: Is the AI assistant working?
- [ ] **Events System**: Can users view/register for events?
- [ ] **Magazine Content**: Is content accessible?
- [ ] **Mobile Experience**: Are mobile users affected?

---

## üìä POST-ROLLBACK VERIFICATION

### **Step 1: Automated Health Checks**
```bash
# Run comprehensive validation
node production-validation-comprehensive.js

# Run load testing on rollback version
node load-test-validator.js

# Check all critical user journeys
node ./tests/critical-user-journeys.js
```

### **Step 2: Manual Verification Checklist**
- [ ] Homepage loads completely (< 3 seconds)
- [ ] Navigation works on all devices
- [ ] IVOR chatbot responds appropriately
- [ ] Magazine articles display correctly
- [ ] Community features are accessible
- [ ] Events calendar functions properly
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] Contact forms submit successfully

### **Step 3: Performance Validation**
```bash
# Monitor key metrics for 30 minutes
- Response times < 2 seconds
- Error rate < 1%
- User session duration normal
- Mobile performance acceptable
```

## üîç FAILURE ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

### **Immediate Documentation**
```markdown
## Deployment Failure Report - [TIMESTAMP]

**Failure Severity**: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
**Rollback Time**: [X minutes from detection to resolution]
**User Impact**: [Description of affected functionality]

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Deployment Trigger**: [What initiated the failed deployment]
2. **Failure Point**: [Where exactly the deployment failed]
3. **Error Messages**: [Key error messages and logs]
4. **Environmental Factors**: [Any environmental issues]

### Resolution Actions
1. **Immediate Response**: [What was done immediately]
2. **Rollback Method**: [Which rollback procedure was used]
3. **Verification Steps**: [How success was confirmed]

### Prevention Measures
1. **Process Improvements**: [Changes to prevent recurrence]
2. **Testing Enhancements**: [Additional validation needed]
3. **Monitoring Updates**: [New alerts or checks to implement]
```

### **Log Collection**
```bash
# Collect deployment logs
mkdir -p ./incident-logs/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
cd ./incident-logs/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Save critical logs
cp /var/log/deployment.log ./
cp ~/.npm/_logs/*.log ./npm-logs/
docker logs [container_id] > docker.log 2>&1

# Save application logs
cp ./api.log ./app-api.log
cp ./website.log ./app-website.log
cp ./monitoring_*.py ./monitoring-scripts/

# Create incident summary
echo "Incident Summary - $(date)" > incident-summary.txt

## üîß PREVENTION MEASURES FOR FUTURE DEPLOYMENTS

### **Pre-Deployment Checklist Enhancement**
```bash
# 1. Always run comprehensive validation first
node production-validation-comprehensive.js
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Validation failed - BLOCKING DEPLOYMENT"
  exit 1
fi

# 2. Create automated backup before deployment
./scripts/create-pre-deployment-backup.sh

# 3. Run smoke tests on staging
npm run test:smoke:staging

# 4. Verify all external services are healthy
./scripts/check-external-services.sh
```

### **Automated Rollback Triggers**
```yaml
# CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement
automated_rollback_conditions:
  - response_time_ms > 5000 for 2 minutes
  - error_rate > 5% for 1 minute  
  - health_check_failures > 3 consecutive
  - user_session_drop > 50% in 5 minutes
