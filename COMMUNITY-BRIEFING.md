# BLKOUT Chrome Extension - Community Member Briefing

## 🎯 **Mission: Crowd Out Mock Data with Real Community Content**

### **The Challenge**
Our BLKOUT platform currently has mock/placeholder data that needs to be replaced with **real community events and news articles**. Manual entry through admin dashboard is too slow - we need community power!

### **The Solution**
A Chrome browser extension that lets **trusted community members** submit events and articles with **one click** from any website.
